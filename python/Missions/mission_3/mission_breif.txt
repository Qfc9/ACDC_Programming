OVERVIEW:
Sweet game, but now that the service members are sober, the game is too easy.
Make the game have a 20% change of lying to the user. So if it's supposed to
say 'Too High' make it respond with 'Too low' and so on. Do not lie on whether
they guess the correct number though. Also, save the score of every play to a
file and have the option to see the current top 5 scores.

Requirements:
- Have correct grammar
- Creates a scoreboard
- Option to display the top 5 scores
- Lies 20% of the time
- Accept only valid input from the user
- Track the amount of guesses
- The program can not crash
- The program needs to be documented
- Try using PIP8 for your coding format
- Turn in the assignment as YOURNAME_guessing.py

Example Play through:
./private_guessing.py
Im thinking of a number between 1 and 100...
Guess my number: 60
60 is too low - guess again: 70
70 is too high - guess again: 65
65 is too low - guess again: 68
68 is too low - guess again: 69
69 is too low - guess again: 71
71 is correct! You guessed my number in 7 guesses
