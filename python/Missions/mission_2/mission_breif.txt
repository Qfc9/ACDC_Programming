OVERVIEW:
Great job with the last project, but these drunken singing service members now
want a game to play while they are trying to sober up at work. Uncle Sam
needs you to create a High-Low guessing game. The game needs to choose a random
number between 1 and 100. Have the player then guess a number and tell them if
they guessed too high, too low or correctly. The program should not end until
the user guesses the correct number. Keep track of how many times they guess
and tell them at the end.

Requirements:
- Have correct grammar
- Accept only valid input from the user
- Track the amount of guesses
- The program can not crash
- The program needs to be documented
- Try using PIP8 for your coding format
- Turn in the assignment as YOURNAME_guessing.py

Example Play through:
./private_guessing.py
Im thinking of a number between 1 and 100...
Guess my number: 50
50 is too low - guess again: 60
60 is too low - guess again: Hello
Hello is not a valid guess - guess again: 90
90 is too high - guess again: 1776
1776 is not a valid guess - guess again: 77
77 is correct! You guessed my number in 4 guesses.
