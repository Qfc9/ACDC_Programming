OVERVIEW:
Base needs a moral boost. The booze is no longer good enough for the service
members. We need you to make a program that will write out all the lyrics to
'99 Bottles' for the service members while they are at work so that they can
sing their favorite drunken melody.

Requirements:
- Have correct pluralization
- Have correct grammar
- Accept a command-line argument to be the new starting number of the program.
    If no command-line argument is supplied, default to 99.
- The project needs to be created in 60 lines or less of code
    (comments and empty lines do not count)
- The program can not crash
- The program needs to be documented
- Try using PIP8 for your coding format
- Turn in the assignment as YOURNAME_bottles.py
